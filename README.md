D-Link introduces a new Wi-Fi extender called DAP-1860. A number of excellent features were brought by this device. Anything?

DAP-1860 is equipped with MU-MIMO feature which is quite rarely found on similar devices. This feature can balance the process of transmitting internet data to multiple devices.

D-Link also pinned two WPS buttons on the DAP-1860. The first WPS button can be used during setup to easily connect the router to the DAP-1860 device.

While the second WPS button is enabled to connect two devices without a password. In this case it is a DAP-1860 device to other devices, such as to a laptop, computer, or smartphone.

DAP-1860 has used AC2600 wireless technology with details of the 2.4GHz frequency of 800Mbps and the 5Ghz frequency of 1800Mbps. In addition, there is a gigabit ethernet port for faster internet.

With this capability, the DAP-1860 is considered suitable for those who like games at home. This device will be marketed later this year in Indonesia.
